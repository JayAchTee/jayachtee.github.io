					</h3>

					<p>
						While I've been developing software since the 1970's I haven't let my skills remain at version 1.0.
					</p>
					<p>
						I started programming in high school math at Southside High School in 1974 developing a Fortran program calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule">trapezodal rule</a> area under a curve.
						In those days, we traveled to Clemson University to use <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/029.html">IBM model 029</a> card punch machines to make a deck of cards to run through the 80 column card readers, 
						the input to the <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP3158.html">IBM 370/158 mainframe</a> across campus.  
						We then walked across the RJE (Remove Job Entry) room to recieve our print out on 132 column "green bar" paper hoping we didn't have in typos.
					</p>
					<p>
						I ended up attending Clemson University and I devoured computer courses on my own, having discovered the power of TSO (Time Sharing Option) and "glass cards".
						I became an expert at assembly language and macros and landed a job on campus writing high speed data filters for the DISD (Division of Information Systems Development).  
						What fun I had!  
						After an education at Clemson, I worked for various small companies who highly valued my assembly language skills and finally wound up at a major manufacturing company as a Systems Programmer.
					</p>

					<h3>
						<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true">
							<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
						</a>Things Change and Change Happens!
					</h3>

					<p>
						Things have changed and I am so grateful!  While mainframes were the "beasts" of computing, IBM launched the original PC in the early 1980's.  I was hooked.  While my peers (and bosses) thought that the PC was a fad, I embraced the technology recognizing the power of seperating the data from the presentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						I remember reading an article titled <a href="http://www.tnooz.com/article/a-tech-reality-if-you-dont-like-change-youre-going-to-like-irrelevance-even-less/#sthash.VIQkyfFX.dpuf">"A tech reality: If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less"</a> by Glenn Gruber.  That title stuck with me, reminded me of the transition days from mainframe to PC and still reminds me of the dynamic evolution of software and hardware.  
						I still use the title as an idiom in team meetings when big change causes us to become uncomfortable.
					</p>

					<h3>
						<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true">
							<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
						</a>And the Winner Is ...
					</h3>

					<p>
						PCs (duh)!  PCs were not a fad and separating the data from the presentation was not a bad idea.  In fact, that's SOP and many of my contempories never knew the joys of dropping a 500 card "tub file" and having to sort it back into proper order giving rise to OTS (Occupational Tourette's Syndrome).
					</p>
					<p>
						I love software development and have embraced technology changes.  
						Today, I use MVC frameworks smashing the data (Models) against the glass (Views) using huge (but rather simple) engines (Controller) to produce usable, effective applications.  
						I've chosen ASP.Net using C# and <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-pages/overview/getting-started/introducing-razor-syntax-(c)">Microsoft Razor MVC</a> framework as my development pattern of choice with a Microsoft SQL Server or RavenDB backend.  
						On the client side, I use jQuery (who doesn't), Bootstrap, Kendo UI, Knockout JS and Angular JS as needed to solve users needs.  
						My professional life is deeper and more complex but this short history creates good conversations over lunch!
					</p>

						<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
						</a>So Where Are We?
					</h3>

					<p>
						While I code professionally and for fun, much of what I do lives behind firewalls and DMZs.  
						I am working on moving some of my code to GitHub but there's a lot of work involved since I've been doing this for over four decades!  
					</p>
					<p>
						I've enjoyed and prospered from the challenges of software development.  
						Over the decades I've developed an almost mystical sense of how things work while being a rather simple fellow. 
						I love to teach and communicate and see the light in other's eyes when they "get it!"
